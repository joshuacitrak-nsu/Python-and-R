## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
numbers <- c(21, 1, 2021)

numbers + 1

```
```{python}
nums = [21, 1, 2021]

# using just nums + 1 will result in a TypeError.  
# Python thinks you want to concatenate.

[each + 1 for each in nums]

```

```{python}
nums = [23, 17, 42, 9]
extra = [3]

nums + extra
```
```{r}
numbers <- c(23, 17, 42, 9)

c(numbers, 3)
```
